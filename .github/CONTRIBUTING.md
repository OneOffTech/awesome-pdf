## Etiquette

This project is open source, and as such, the maintainers give their free time to maintain the list and references held within. They make the list freely available in the hope that it will be of use to other developers and users. It would be extremely unfair for them to suffer abuse or anger for their hard work.

Please be considerate towards maintainers when raising issues or presenting pull requests. Let's show the
world that developers are civilized and selfless people.

It's the duty of the maintainer to ensure that all submissions to the project are of sufficient
quality to benefit the project. Respect the maintainer's decision, and do not be upset or abusive if your submission is not used.


## Add an entry to the list

1. Create a new issue using the Add Entry template
1. Use the title field to include the name of the entry
1. Use the appropriate sections of the template to enter the main URL/link to the service/library
1. Enter a brief description of the service/library
1. Select the best category where the entry should be listed (currently only one category, so select the best fit)

A maintainer will review your request, you'll be notified when your suggestion is included.

## Add a category

Curating a simple and accessible categorization is a challenge. Classification is subjective. We are considering the following categories so far:

- **Parsers, OCR and extraction**. Services and libraries that are related to extract text, images or structured from PDFs
- **Readers and viewers**. Applications or libraries that allow to showcase PDF in applications or on websites.
- **Creation and production**. Libraries or services that reduce time to produce PDFs or allow transformation of existing PDFs
- **Accessibility**. Accessibility and long term conservation
- **Datasets**. PDF datasets to use for training of vision-based AI/ML models or to test applications dealing with PDF processing.


Need a new category? [Open a discussion](https://github.com/OneOffTech/awesome-pdf/discussions/new/choose) providing the rationale of the category.


## Curation
